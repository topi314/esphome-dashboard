# ESPHome Dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using an ESP32 without PSRAM this does not seem to work with esphome 2025.2.0+. I recommend using an older version of esphome until I find a solution.

A simple Go service to render a custom HTML/CSS dashboard as a PNG image from [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) entities.

This service is intended to be used with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) devices that have a display and can show a PNG image.

## Installation

You can either run the binary directly on your machine or use the provided Docker image.

### Docker Compose

Here is an example [`compose.yml`](compose.yml) file to get you started:

```yaml
services:
  esphome-dashboard:
    image: ghcr.io/topi314/esphome-dashboard:latest
    container_name: esphome-dashboard
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      # Mount your configuration file
      - ./config.toml:/var/lib/esphome-dashboard/config.toml
      # Mount your dashboard configuration & templates
      - ./dashboards/:/var/lib/esphome-dashboard/dashboards/
    ports:
      # Expose the service on port 8080
      - "8080:8080"
```

### ESPHome

## Configuration

The configuration is done via a TOML file. You can find an example configuration in the [example directory](example.config.toml).

To get a Home Assistant API token, follow the instructions [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token).

```toml
# Enable hot reloading of the built-in templates (only useful for development)
dev = false
# The address the server should listen on
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0"
# The port the server should listen on
listen_port = 8080
# The directory where your dashboards are stored
dashboard_dir = "/var/lib/esphome-dashboard/dashboards/"

[log]
# The log level (debug, info, warn, error)
level = "info"
# The log format (text, json, log-fmt)
format = "text"
# Whether to add the source location to the log output
add_source = true
# Whether to add the log level to the log output (only useful for text format)
no_color = false

# The Home Assistant configuration (optional)
[home_assistant]
# The hostname/IP of your Home Assistant instance
host = "localhost"
# The port of your Home Assistant instance
port = 80
# Whether to use HTTPS or HTTP to connect to Home Assistant
secure = false
# The Home Assistant API token
token = ""
```

### Dashboard Configuration

The dashboard configuration is also done via a TOML file. You can find an example configuration [here](dashboards/default/config.toml).

```toml
# The width in pixels of the dashboard (should be the same as the display width)
width = 800
# The height in pixels of the dashboard (should be the same as the display height)
height = 480
# The base template to use for the dashboard
# The path is relative to the dashboard directory
base = 'base.gohtml'
# The pages which can be injected into the base template
# The paths are relative to the dashboard directory
pages = [
    'pages/forecast.gohtml',
    'pages/mealplan.gohtml',
    'pages/calendar.gohtml',
    'pages/timeline.gohtml',
    'pages/pokemon-go-timeline.gohtml',
]

# The Home Assistant configuration (optional)
[home_assistant]
# The entities to fetch from Home Assistant
entities = [
    { name = 'Forecast', id = 'weather.forecast_home' },
]
# The calendars to fetch from Home Assistant (optional)
# name: The name of the calendar (used in the template)
# ids: The IDs of the calendars entities which should be fetched and merged
# days: The number of days to fetch events for (please note it we always start fetching from the week start (Monday))
# max_events: The maximum number of events to fetch from all calendars combined (optional)
# skip_past_events: Whether to skip past events (optional)
calendars = [
    { name = 'Mealie', ids = ['calendar.mealie_dinner', 'calendar.mealie_lunch'], days = 7 },
    { name = 'Calendar', ids = ['calendar.konzerte', 'calendar.urlaub', 'calendar.feiertage'], days = 28 },
    { name = 'Timeline', ids = ['calendar.konzerte', 'calendar.urlaub', 'calendar.feiertage'], days = 28, max_events = 10, skip_past_events = true },
    { name = 'PokemonGo', ids = ['calendar.pokemon_go_local_events'], days = 28, max_events = 10, skip_past_events = true },
]
# The services to call from Home Assistant (optional)
# name: The name of the service (used in the template)
# domain: The domain of the service
# service: The service to call
# return_response: Whether the service returns a response (optional)
# data: The data to send to the service (optional)
services = [
    { name = 'WeatherForecasts', domain = 'weather', service = 'get_forecasts', return_response = true, data = { entity_id = 'weather.forecast_home', type = 'daily' } },
]
```

### ESPHome Configuration

Here is an example ESPHome configuration for an `ESP32` with a `WaveShare 7.5inch e-Paper HAT (v2)` display & touch sensitive buttons.

Make sure to copy [`config/common/dashboard-base.yaml`](config/common/dashboard-base.yaml) to your ESPHome configuration directory (e.g. `esphome/common/dashboard-base.yaml`).

```yaml
packages:
  dashboard: !include
    file: common/dashboard-base.yaml
    vars:
      touch_threshold: 1000 # Change this to a higher value if the touch buttons are too sensitive
      display_rotation: 0째 # Change this to 90째, 180째 or 270째 if your display is rotated
      base_url: 'http://192.168.178.68:1234' # Change this to the IP of your dashboard server
      dashboard_name: 'default' # Change this to the name of your dashboard

esphome:
  name: dashboard
  friendly_name: Dashboard
  name_add_mac_suffix: false

wifi:
  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

```

## Templates

The dashboard is rendered using Go templates. You can find an example dashboard in the [example directory](dashboards/default).

To get started with go templates I recommend reading the [`text/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) and the [`html/template`](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) documentation.

### Base Template

The base template is a Go template which can be used to render the dashboard. You can find an example base template [here](dashboards/default/base.gohtml).
This template then includes the other pages which can be injected into the base template.

You can include the current Page with the following code:

```html
{{ template "page" . }}
```

Each page is additionally a Go template with the filename as the template name.

You can include the other pages with the following code:

```html
{{ template "forecast.gohtml" . }}
```

You can also include frontmatter in the templates to pass additional data to the template which is available in the `Vars` variable.
For pages they are available via `{{ .Page.Vars }}` and `{{ $page index .Pages 0 }} {{ $page.Vars }}` for the base template.

```html
---
title: "Weather"
---
<span>{{ .Vars.title }}</span>
```

You can include assets via the `assets` directory in the dashboard directory. The assets are then available via the `/dashboards/{dashboard}/assets/` route.
You can use a relative path to the assets directory in the template. For example, to include a CSS file you can use the following code:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/style.css">
```

Here is the example base template:

```html
<style>
    @font-face {
        font-family: 'Gotham Round';
        font-style: normal;
        src: url("../assets/gothamrnd.otf") format("opentype");
    }

    * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    html, body {
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        font-family: 'Gotham Round', system-ui;
    }

    body {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }

    h1 {
        margin: 0;
        font-size: 40px;
        text-transform: uppercase;
        font-weight: bolder;
    }

    .page {
        width: 100%;
        flex-grow: 1;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
        overflow: hidden;
    }

    .container {
        height: 100%;
        width: 100%;
        padding: 0 10px;
    }
</style>
<body id="root">
<div class="page">
    {{ template "page" . }}
</div>
{{ template "pages" . }}
{{ template "gen-time" }}
</body>
```

#### Page Template

The page template gets injected into the base template and can be used to render the content you want to display. You can find an example page
template [here](dashboards/default/pages/forecast.gohtml).

Styles and scripts are shared between the base and page templates.

This template calls the built-in [`forecast`](templates/forecast.gohtml) template which displays the weather forecast using
the [Home Assistant Weather Forecast](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather/#action-weatherget_forecasts) action.

It expects the following data to be passed to the template:

- `Now`: The current weather forecast entity from Home Assistant
- `Forecast`: The weather forecast service response from Home Assistant

```html
<h1>Weather</h1>
<div class="container">
    {{ $now := index .HomeAssistant.Entities.Forecast }}
    {{ $forecast := index .HomeAssistant.Services.WeatherForecasts.ServiceResponse "weather.forecast_home" }}
    {{ template "forecast" dict "Now" $now "Forecast" $forecast }}
</div>

```
